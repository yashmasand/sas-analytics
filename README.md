# Visual Text Analytics with SAS Model Studio

In this project, we provide data analysis within the context of a business application.
The data set has been generated from individual text files that were extracted from an online forum.

## Task 1:  How many documents mention a medication, or a dosage, or a side effect?
&nbsp;
So, we have plotted a bar chart that shows the number of documents that contain a medication, the number of documents that contain a dosage, and the number of documents that contain a side effect.

## Task 2: How many documents mention each medication?
&nbsp;
We have displayed the counts of number of documents that mention each of the following medications:
Abidal, Cenerol, Ecstapin, Fortifex, Prexifan

## Task 3: Which medications are associated with sleep issues?
&nbsp;
We have identified the medications that are associated with sleep issues according to their degree of association, highlighting the stronger associations.

## Task 4: What are the most common concerns expressed?
&nbsp;
To complete this task, we've determined the main concerns expressed in the posts.

## Task 5: Provide any useful additional information.
&nbsp;
Here, we've provided additional charts that would help us find some additional useful information about drug effects on patients. For this task, in addition to explaining how the charts were produced and how to read them, we've also explained how the information is useful to us.
